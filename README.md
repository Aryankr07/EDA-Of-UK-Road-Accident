# EDA-Of-UK-Road-Accident


The Dataset was of 1.5 million rows, where I deployed some of the Python libraries to Clean & analyze the data like Pandas, Numpy, seaborn, and Matplotlib.

While working on the project I pulled out some of the insights which I would like to share with everyone. I identified areas with average police presence in the high-rated accident zones, also LSOAs with the highest accident rates. Some of the years which recorded the maximum number of accidents. At which time most of the crashes took place. And many more which you can check below.

The purpose was to provide valuable information for improving road safety and implementing measures to reduce accidents in high-risk areas. It was a challenging yet rewarding project that underlines the importance of data analysis in enhancing public safety.
